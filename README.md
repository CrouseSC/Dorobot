Bugs and missing features are to be expected.

#### X feature doesn't work, what do?
Make sure its both enabled in the menu (if applicable) and that you've set a bind for it.

This fork includes extra features all created by ChatGPT5. I have little to no experience coding and wanted to see just how far AI has come and it did a phenomenal job. I ran into many roadblocks/errors when compiling this fork but ChatGPT5 always got me back on track.

## Additional features
1. Added more FPS options to force in the bind menu. ie Force 142, 125, 15
2. Enhanced Elebot. (this is kinda iffy. some maps it works great others not so much. Tried improving drop eles to act more like Anvil TAS' Elebot)
3. Added a override bot bind that doesn't override AutoFPS.
4. Added a SpamSavePos that will spam the SavePos bind. useful for quickly getting into a drop ele position.
5. Changed Assets.7z to show MW2's Spinning 10th Prestige embelem

I will be actively working to get more features added in with ChatGPT5's help. If you have suggestions please reach out to me on discord @ Crouse_

I am not the original developer 100% of the credit goes to him and ChatGPT5 for this Fork... all i did was type prompts.
