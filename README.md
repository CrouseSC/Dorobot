# Dorobot
Open source bot for CoD4, based on https://github.com/Martind180/AvengersTool

Bugs and missing features are to be expected.

## Installation
1. Move Dorobot.asi into your Cod4/miles folder
2. Extract Assets.7z to your Cod4 folder (so the "Dorobot" folder will be in your CoD4 root)
## FAQ, known issues
#### X feature doesn't work, what do?
Make sure its both enabled in the menu (if applicable) and that you've set a bind for it.
#### Textboxes don't work!
Alt-tab out of CoD4 and back
